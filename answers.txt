Number of late days you are taking on this lab: 0




Collaborators (who you talked to about the lab, what you talked about): Eiko Reisz Discussed approaches for implementing -R. Boiled down to whether we should follow the ls output (breadth first) and store all directories in a 2D or string pointer array which we would then call after printing the current directory, or use a depth first approach and just call list_dir whenever you encounter a directory 





Source material that you consulted:
Man Pages for errno, stat, getlong_opt, and more
Using floor function in C: https://www.techonthenet.com/c_language/standard_library_functions/math_h/floor.php 
Content from review sessions about string concatenation in C.



Other acknowledgments: I forgot to fill out this page for my last lab, but I sent an email about it so please forgive me.






Anything else you'd like us to know: I added the math module and had to add the -lm flag to the Makefile in order to use floor to implement -h flag
